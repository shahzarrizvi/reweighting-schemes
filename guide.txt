in both plots/ and models/, there are a number of directories. each directory corresponds to one experiment. each experiment contains multiple files of the form "set_[num]", which contains the experiment data for that particular run of that experiment.

mlc_c_param: different parametrizations for C(f).
    set_0: mu = 0.1
    set_1: mu = 1.1
    
sqr_c_parm: different parametrizations for C(f).
    set_0: mu = 0.1
    set_1: mu = 1.1
    
interp: running with different values of mu.
    set_0: mu = 0.1
    set_1: mu = 1.1
    set_2: mu = 1.2
    set_3: mu = 1.5
    set_4: mu = 5
    
loss_comp: comparing all losses together.
    set_0: mu = 0.1
    set_1: mu = 1.1
