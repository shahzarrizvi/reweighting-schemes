\subsection{Detector-level}

\paragraph{Muons} are ...

\paragraph{Tracks} are reconstructed from charged-particle hits within the silicon- and straw-tube based inner tracking detectors. They are required to pass the X quality working point and to be associated with the primary vertex of the event using the X track-to-vertex association.  The primary vertex is defined  as the reconstructed vertex with the highest sum of associated track $\pt^2$.  Tracks are required to have a $\pt>500$~\MeV~to be included in this measurement.  The track $\eta$ and $\phi$ coordinates come from the five-parameter track fit to $(\eta,\phi,q/p,d_0,z_0)$, and thus correspond to the track coordinates at the origin.  

\subsection{Particle-level}

Stable charged particles ($c\tau$ > 10 mm) are used to define the analog of tracks at particle-level.  Charged-particles are required to have $\pt > 500$~\MeV~and $|\eta|<2.5$.
