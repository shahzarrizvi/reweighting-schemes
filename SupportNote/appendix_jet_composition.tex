\section{Particle composition and detector response of hadronic recoil}

This section examines the particle composition and the detector response of the leading jet that balance the $Z$~boson in the fiducial region of the analysis. 
The Powehg $Z\to \mu\mu$ sample is used. The particle origin of each track is obtained using the \texttt{truthParticleLink} to find the truth identification of each reconstructed track (see section~\ref{sec:samples}). In addition to the standard event preselection described in section~\ref{sec:selection}, extra cuts are used to make sure the leading reconstructed jet matches the leading particle jet in each event. 
%To ensure the closet matching between the leading reconstructed jet and leading truth jet, and always have very good DR between them, the cut on ratio of 
This is achieved by requiring $|y_\mathrm{j1}|<2.1$ and $\pTlj / \pTsj < 0.7$. The selection is applied on reconstructed level. However, due to the additional criterion, the leading particle-level (truth) jet will always match the leading reco jet. Note that the jets will have a very high \pt{} since the event selection includes the selection $\pTll > \SI{165}{\GeV}$, and the jet will have a similar \pt{} to that of the $Z$~boson.




The following classification is used to label charged particles:
\begin{itemize}
\item A reconstructed track that is well-matched to a charged-particle in the simulation (see Sec. 6.2 for
the association criteria).
\begin{itemize}
\item The charged-particle is inside the particle-level jet that matches the detector-level jet.
\begin{itemize}
\item  If the charged-particle is a pion [$\rightarrow$ pion ]
\item  If the charged-particle is a kaon [$\rightarrow$ kaon]
\item  If the charged-particle is a proton [$\rightarrow$ proton]
\item  If the charged-particle is a muon [$\rightarrow$ mu]
\item  If the charged-particle is a electron [$\rightarrow$ e]
\item  If the charged-particle is a strange [$\rightarrow$strange]
\item  If the charged-particle is a neutral[$\rightarrow$neutral]
\item  If the charged-particle is a photon [$\rightarrow$gam]
\item  If the charged-particle is any other strange [$\rightarrow$strange]
\end{itemize}
\item A reconstructed track that is not well-matched to a charged-particle, is labeled as [ $\rightarrow$unmatched]. The following can be source of these unmatched tracks:
\begin{itemize}
\item The track came from a different pp interaction [$\rightarrow$ pileup tracks]
\item A reconstructed track that is not well-matched to a charged-particle in the simulation [$\rightarrow$fake].
\item Tracks came from secondary particles [$\rightarrow$ secondary particle tracks]
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

All of the reconstructed tracks inside leading jet as well as charged-particles in the associated particle-level jets that are not matched to reconstructed tracks are used for the plots shown in this section. Figure~\ref{fig:fraction of charged particles in reco jet} shows the fraction of the particle multiplicity (left) as a function of the truth jet \pT. The 78\% of reconstructed tracks make up pions about of the total, kaons are about 12\% of the total, protons are about 4\%, unmatched tracks are around 5\% and strange are almost 1\%. The momentum fraction as a function of jet pT is shown in right in Figure~\ref{fig:fraction of charged particles in reco jet}. The momentum fraction for different particles varies slightly as compare to multiplicity fraction.

Figure~\ref{fig:fraction of charged particles in truth jet} shows the fraction of the charged particle multiplicity (left) and their \pT  as a function of the truth jet \pT in the particle-level jet. From charged particle compositions, mostly are pions ~74\%, kaons are 14\% and rest 12\% comprise other charged particle.
Figure~\ref{fig:fraction of charged particles in truth jet} shows similar plots for particle level jet, but for all the particle compositions in the leading jet. From the multiplicity fraction plot (left), it can be seen that ~43\% are photons which are ~20\% greater than in \pt fraction (right) dur to decay of pions into photons.


Figures~\ref{fig:response pion and kaon} to ~\ref{fig:track jet response} are showing the detector response for each particle category. The pion and kaon respose are ~93\% and ~94\% respectively which indicates tracking efficiency is around 93\%. Figure~\ref{fig:unmatched tracks fraction} depicts fraction of unmatched track w.r.t reco level jet, which indicates ~2\% tracking inefficiency. Similarly, figures~\ref{fig:fraction pions and kaons} to ~\ref{fig:response electrons and starnge particles} are showing the fraction of individual particles at truth level and reconstructed level. As shown in figure~\ref{fig:fraction of charged particles in truth jet}, pions make most of jet fraction, and for muons, electrons and strange particles this fraction is much lower. the muon and electron responses are very low because these particles come from semileptonic decay of heavy hadrons, so we have a displaced vertex
