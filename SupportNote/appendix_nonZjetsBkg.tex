\section{Non $Z$+jets background processes}
\label{app:bkg-processes}

The event selection described in section~\ref{sec:selection} targets $Z\to\mu\mu$ in the high \pTll{} region. This results in an extremely pure sample of strong $Z\to\mu\mu$ production, which is the process used in the unfolding (see section~\ref{sec:mc}). To investigate the contribution from other processes, n-tuples from the VBF-Z analysis were used, which measured EW $Zjj$ production (``VBF Z'') using both $\mu\mu$ and $ee$ data and MC. This analysis required two jets, however the n-tuples saved all events after the dilepton selection, so it was trivial to reported the event selection of this analysis.
