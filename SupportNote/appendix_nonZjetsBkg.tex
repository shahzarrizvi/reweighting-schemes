\section{Non $Z$+jets background processes}
\label{app:bkg-processes}

The event selection described in section~\ref{sec:selection} targets $Z\to\mu\mu$ in the high \ptll{} region. This results in an extremely pure sample of strong $Z\to\mu\mu$ production, which is the process used in the unfolding (see section~\ref{sec:mc}). To investigate the contribution from other processes,
