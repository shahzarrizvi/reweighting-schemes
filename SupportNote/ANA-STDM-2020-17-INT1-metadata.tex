\AtlasAbstract{%
This support note describes a measurement of all charged particle properties in $Z$+jets events using the full Run 2 $pp$ collision dataset recorded by the ATLAS detector.  In particular, this is the first analysis to unfold data without binning and using a variable-length and high-dimensional phase space.  The phase space space is defined by the kinematic properties of all charged particles in boosted $Z\to\mu\mu$ events within a fiducial volume. The unfolding is implemented using the recently proposed OmniFold technique, which uses iteratively trained neural networks.  The analysis itself is broken into two part and this note serves as the reference for both parts.  The first part considers the case of a fixed number of observables (MultiFold) while the second part considers the case of all charged particles (OmniFold).
