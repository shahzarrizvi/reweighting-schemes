\subsection{Data}

This analysis is performed using data from $pp$ collisions provided from the Large Hadron Collider with $\sqrt{s} = 13$~\TeV~between 2015--2018, and collected with the ATLAS detector. The total integrated luminosity of this dataset following the application of the GoodRunsList is 139~fb$^{-1}\pm1.7\%$. The specific GoodRunsList files used are...
